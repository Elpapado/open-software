# Best Practices for FAIR and Open Science Software

Modern research relies on software, and building upon or reproducing that research requires access to the full source code behind that software. Unfortunately, software is not always developed following best practices that ensure its quality and sustainability.

There are [four simple recommendations to encourage best practices in open research software](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-876/v1) which provide a simple, yet robust framework of recommendations that encourage the adoption of existing best practices in research software development.

1. Make source code publicly accessible from day 

2. Adopt a license and comply with the license of third-party dependencies

3. Define clear and transparent contribution, governance and communication processes

4. Make software easy to discover by providing software metadata via a popular community registry
