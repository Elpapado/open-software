# Open Science Software

_the following text is adapted from the [Open Science Training Handbook](https://open-science-training-handbook.gitbook.io/book/02opensciencebasics)_

Open research software, or open-source research software, refers to the use and development of software for analysis, simulation, visualization, etc. where the full source code is available. In addition, according to the [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd), open-source software must be distributed in source and/or compiled form \(with the source code available in the latter case\), and must be shared under a license that allows modification, derivation, and redistribution.

There are several different platforms that support open sharing and collaboration on software, research or otherwise. First of all, you can use this checklist to evaluate openness of existing research software:

- Is the software available to download and install?

- Can the software easily be installed on different platforms?

- Does the software have conditions on the use?

- Is the source code available for inspection?

- Is the full history of the source code available for inspection through a publicly available version history?

- Are the dependencies of the software (hardware and software) described properly? Do these dependencies require only a reasonably minimal amount of effort to obtain and use?

These qualities relate to and build on the [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd).

## The Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) model

_the following text is adapted from [UNESCO](https://en.unesco.org/freeandopensourcesoftware)_

The Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) model provides interesting tools and processes with which women and men can create, exchange, share and exploit software and knowledge efficiently and effectively. FOSS can play an important role as a practical instrument for development as its free and open aspirations make it a natural component of development efforts in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).


- Software plays a crucial role in access to information and knowledge;
- Different software models, including proprietary, open-source and free software, have many possibilities to increase competition, access by users, diversity of choice and to enable all users to develop solutions which best meet their requirements;
- The development and use of open, interoperable, non-discriminatory standards for information handling and access are important elements in the development of effective infostructures;
- The community approaches to software development has great potential to contribute to operationalize the concept of Knowledge Societies;
- The Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) model provides interesting tools and processes with which people can create, exchange, share and exploit software and knowledge efficiently and effectively;
- FOSS can play an important role as a practical instrument for development as its free and open aspirations make it a natural component of development efforts in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs);
- Consistent support plays an important role in the success and sustainability of FOSS solutions;
- All software choices should be based upon the solution's ability to achieve the best overall return on technology investments.
